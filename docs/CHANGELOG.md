  - `managers/SeatManager.js` - Seat operations (~200 lines)
  - `managers/SectionInteractionHandler.js` - User interactions (~180 lines)
  - `managers/ResizeHandleManager.js` - GA resize handles (~300 lines)

  - Removed 80% code duplication between createSection and createGASection

### Fixed
- **Stretch and curve transformations now preserve alignment with deleted seats** - Complete rewrite of transformation algorithms to properly handle sections where seats have been deleted
  - **Virtual Grid Concept**: Transformations treat seats as if they exist on a complete virtual grid, with deleted seats leaving logical gaps
  - **Stretch transformation improvements**:
    - Uses `colIndex` to calculate logical column positions (preserves gaps from deleted seats)
    - Processes each row independently to maintain row-specific alignment
    - Calculates alignment offset per row based on `section.rowAlignment` (left/center/right)
    - Uses standard 24px grid spacing as base for logical structure
    - Stretch affects spacing only, not logical grid positions
    - Vertical stretch applied consistently across all rows
  - **Curve transformation improvements**:
    - Finds longest row and uses its center as the curve's vertical axis of symmetry
    - Calculates stable logical columns using BASE spacing (24px), not stretched spacing
    - Logical column indices remain constant when stretch is applied
    - Uses polar-to-Cartesian conversion for proper circular arc
    - Subtracts `curveDY` to create upward theater-style curve (not downward)
    - Stretch affects arc length spacing while preserving logical grid structure
    - Works correctly with all alignment types (left/center/right)
  - **Row alignment improvements**:
    - Calculates virtual row width including gaps from deleted seats
    - Uses `colIndex` offsets to preserve spacing for missing seats
    - Properly positions seats based on logical grid positions
  - **Key benefits**:
    - Alignment (left/center/right) is preserved during all transformations
    - Deleted seats create consistent gaps regardless of transformation
    - Curve creates proper theater-style upward arc
    - More intuitive and maintainable code with clear variable names
- **Multi-section alignment preserving row alignment**
  - Added `rebuildBasePositions()` function to reconstruct clean 24px grid from row/column indices
  - Added `skipLayout` option to prevent dimension recalculation during transformations
  - Rewrote all 6 alignment methods (alignLeft, alignRight, alignTop, alignBottom, alignCenterHorizontal, alignCenterVertical) to treat sections as rigid blocks
  - Removed three-phase flatten/restore pattern that was causing dimension recalculation
  - New approach: Apply transforms with skipLayout → Align positions → Position seats
- **Seat positioning on file load** - Fixed critical issue where seats appeared outside the bounding box after loading files. Root cause: layout shift was being applied twice - once by modifying `relativeX/Y` in `updateRowLabels()` and again by `positionSeatsAndLabels()` during positioning. Solution: Only apply shift to labels, let `positionSeatsAndLabels()` handle seat positioning using `seat.x = section.x + (seat.relativeX + layoutShiftX) - pivot.x`
- **Seat number preservation** - Fixed issue where seat numbers were being recalculated on file load instead of preserving the exact numbers shown. This is critical when seats have been deleted - remaining seats must keep their original numbers (e.g., seats 1, 2, 5 after deleting 3, 4). Solution: Restore `number` field from saved data and skip `updateSeatNumbers()` call when loading files with individual seat data
- **Row alignment and transformation restoration** - Fixed critical issue where rows with different lengths (e.g., rows A-D with fewer seats) would lose their right/left alignment after save/load, and sections with curve/stretch transformations would revert to base positions. Root causes: (1) Only saving `baseX/baseY` without transformed positions, (2) Transformation recalculation was skipped but positions weren't preserved. Solution: Now save BOTH `baseX/baseY` (for editing) AND `relativeX/relativeY` (final transformed positions). On load, restore transformed positions, calculate proper layout shift for bounding box, and use `_loadedFromFile` flag to prevent repositioning. After load completes, flag is cleared so future edits work correctly
- **Row alignment not persisting** - Left/right aligned seats now maintain alignment after save/load
- **Section positions drifting** - Exact center positions stored to prevent floating-point errors
- **Seat positions misaligned** - Base seat positions restored from file and recalculated on load
- **Multi-section drag not working** - Fixed by preserving selection when clicking already-selected section
- **Delete section errors** - Added safety checks for undefined objects (labels, handles)
- Bounding box not resizing after row label removal
- Bounding box includes hidden labels in calculations
- Section deselection on canvas click in Edit Seats mode
- Labels positioned outside bounding box after alignment
- Seat selection lag behind selection rectangle
- Section color lost when adding labels or transforming
- Collision detection not accounting for section pivot point
- Section dragging collision detection using wrong coordinates
- Section alignment not accounting for pivot point
- Section selection hit area not matching visual bounds
- Zoom to fit not accounting for pivot point and labels
- Resize handles not rotating with GA section rotation
- Resize handles not moving with section during drag
- Resize handles remaining visible after deselection
- Space key preventing input in text fields
- Resize handle hit areas too small for easy interaction
- Resize handles not working outside section bounds
- Circular dependency between SectionManager and AlignmentManager resolved with events
- **Alignment tool now properly handles curved and stretched sections**
- **Drag threshold prevents accidental drags (5px minimum movement)**
- **Rotation slider displays correctly in -180 to 180 range**
- **Section selection immediately updates sidebar values**
